# Entity Mapping Summary (JPA / Hibernate)

## What Does "Mapping" Mean?

In the context of JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Boot, **mapping** refers to
the process of connecting a Java class and its fields to database tables
and columns. Mapping defines how objects are stored, retrieved, and
related inside the database.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Entity Mapping**

A Java class annotated with `@Entity` is mapped to a database table.\
Each field becomes a column unless otherwise specified.

``` java
@Entity
@Table(name = "owners")
public class Owner { ... }
```

This tells JPA:

-   Create/use a table named `owners`
-   Store each `Owner` object as a row in that table

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. **Primary Key Mapping**

``` java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
```

This maps the `id` field as:

-   The primary key of the table\
-   Auto-generated by the database

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. **Relationship Mapping**

Mapping also defines how entities relate.

Example:

``` java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")
private List<Apartment> apartments;
```

This tells JPA:

-   One `Owner` can have many `Apartment` entries
-   The relationship is defined on the `owner` field inside `Apartment`

This results in a foreign key column `owner_id` in the `apartments`
table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

  Mapping Type                 Purpose
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  `@Entity`                    Maps a class to a database table
  `@Table`                     Customizes the table name
  `@Id`                        Defines the primary key
  `@GeneratedValue`            Controls how IDs are generated
  `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`   Maps relationships between tables
  `mappedBy`                   Defines which side owns the relationship

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Mapping Matters

-   It enables automatic table creation (DDL generation)
-   It allows Hibernate to persist Java objects
-   It ensures proper foreign key relationships
-   It keeps your domain model and database in sync

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

**Mapping is the bridge between Java objects and database structures.**\
It allows JPA and Hibernate to translate your classes into tables,
fields into columns, and object references into relationships. Without
proper mapping, persistence would not be possible.
